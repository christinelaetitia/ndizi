We are #TeamNdizi (banana in Swahili).  We are in DC at the DataKind World Bank DataDive on March 16, 2013 scraping food prices from websites around the world.

##Banana

We started our day by scraping crowdsourced banana prices from [here](http://www.humuch.com/prices/Bananas/______/22). We wrote a scraper [here](https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/banana-scraping/) and made the below price visualization by continent.  After this, 4 people, new to scraping, set off to write their own scrapers.

Our data is also posted in the [banana](https://github.com/mjrich/ndizi/tree/master/banana) directory.

##Africa (especially Kenya)

We scraped the mfarm data from Kenya.  This is SMS data sent to kenyan farmers to help them know prices in different markets.  We have reporposed these "data exhaust" which can now be visualized like the below:
