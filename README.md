![Alt text](/banana/peanut-butter-jelly-time.gif)

We are [#TeamNdizi](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23TeamNdizi) (banana in Swahili) in DC at the DataKind World Bank DataDive on March 16, 2013 scraping food prices from websites around the world.

Here's the link to our [hackpad](https://hackpad.com/Scraping-Websites-to-Collect-Consumption-and-Price-Data-SXoIdM1XFyw).

##Banana

We started our day by scraping crowdsourced banana prices from [here](http://www.humuch.com/prices/Bananas/______/22). We wrote a scraper [here](https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/banana-scraping/) and made the below price visualization by continent.  After this, 4 people, new to scraping, set off to write their own scrapers.

Our data is also posted in the [banana](https://github.com/mjrich/ndizi/tree/master/banana) directory.

##Africa (especially Kenya)

We scraped the [mfarm](http://www.mfarm.co.ke/) data from Kenya.  This is SMS data sent to kenyan farmers to help them know prices in different markets.  We have repurposed these "data exhaust" which can now be visualized like the below:

Our scraper code and data is also posted in the [mfarm/data](https://github.com/mjrich/ndizi/tree/master/mfarm/data) directory.



We copied/pasted & learned to scrape consumption data from websites in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.  We also looked at some data from South Africa.

Our data is in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmiN1lPwld-EdFRXLXNUTWdjWnF6MDR1S0FObW5lUWc#gid=3) and some data is also posted in the [africa](https://github.com/mjrich/ndizi/tree/master/africa) directory.  A scraper for numbeo Uganda is [here](https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/numbeo-ethiopia_1/).


##Indonesia

We also scraped rice prices from twitter and the [carrefour indonesia website](http://www.carrefour.co.id/).  We even used the [way-back machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) to scrape older price data from carrefour.
